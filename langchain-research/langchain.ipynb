This can cause a lot of problems if you get started with a simple framework but then discover that you need to refactor your application to accommodate the next user request. Shiny for Python differs from other frameworks because it has tremendous range. You can build a small application in a few minutes with the confidence that the framework can handle much more complex problems.
